Rust ZeroMQ bindings.

**JWL: This fork mainly moves to dynamic linking of `libzmq`.  The library must be installed to the system path for this crate to work!**

# About

The `zmq` crate provides bindings for the `libzmq` library from the
[ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/) project. The API exposed by `zmq` should
be safe (in the usual Rust sense), but it follows the C API closely,
so it is not very idiomatic.

# Compatibility

The aim of this project is to track latest zmq releases as close as possible.

Regarding the minimum Rust version required, `zmq` is CI-tested on current 
stable channels of Rust. 

# Usage

`zmq` is a pretty straight forward port of the C API into Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let ctx = zmq::Context::new();

    let socket = ctx.socket(zmq::REQ).unwrap();
    socket.connect("tcp://127.0.0.1:1234").unwrap();
    socket.send("hello world!", 0).unwrap();
}
```

You can find more usage examples in
https://github.com/erickt/rust-zmq/tree/master/examples.
